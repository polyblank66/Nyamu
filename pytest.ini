    compilation: Unity compilation tests
    asmdef: Assembly definition specific tests
    slow: Tests that take longer to run
    structural: Tests that modify Unity project structure (files/directories)
    protocol: Pure MCP protocol tests that don't need Unity state management
    fast: Fast tests (protocol + simple MCP tests)
